Testing Combat Simulation (3/20/2023):

    All testing is done via running the program and making sure all the numbers, the outputs, and the inputs are correct. The health of both parties have been checked and tested to make sure the correct variable is changing by the correct amount. The outputs are checked to make sure there are no typos, printing errors, and that all the outputs are correct.
